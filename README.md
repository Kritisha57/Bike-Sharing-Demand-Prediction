# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction-Capstone Project
#Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. The goal is to design different Machine Learning models and come up with the model which gives the best prediction of rented bike count required to be supplied at each hour. Before designing any ML model, we require to clean the data and draw significant insights from the data. To begin with we view the dataset including its description, various columns, number of null values, different categorical variables, unique value count, shape of the dataset and different statistical parameters. We begin by removing the null values if any. Then we plot the distributions of each variable to see how the data is distributed. We get an idea about the skewness of the data.
